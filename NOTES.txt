top level module inputs and outputs are initialized by the .qsf file --> check set_global_assignment -name values

RGB
000 = black
001 = blue
010 = green
011 = cyan
100 = red
101 = magenta
110 = yellow

13.1.2 for more colors?

vga port:
- 5 signals: horizontal + vertical sync, r, g, b
- video signal is analog, sent through dac in video controller

horizontal + vertical sync? can i use doublesync? look for this in code -- should be in output to vga port? *VGA_HS, VGA_VS sent into qsys module
check page 12.2.4 for hdl of vga_sync + testing modules -- maybe try this?

what is video_on signal? its a wire in vga_sync

characters / objects: plot_graph.v seems complex? maybe graph_bars.v is easier?
store characters and objects in rom?
characters: use tile mapped scheme -- 8x8 square of pixels, treat these like mini displays 
where were the buttons?

UI:
choose game: use cursor to select mode, press key to go back to home page
restart game?
game over?
display data?
high scores?
